A simple, fun, and intense memory card game.

I spent about 2 weeks working on this program and I would like to fix a bug with resetting while the timer is counting down but other than that it was fun to build and everything works.

The way it works is you press start and it runs a few functions that flip cards and starts the timer then when the timer is done it flips the cards over. Then you click the cards you remember are the same and if they match they will stay flipped over. If you get a score of 9 you get the highscore and if you get a higher score you still win but you can click reset to try for a higher score. 

We have a few cool features where you can change it to dark and light mode as well as change the images on the cards for a different theme. 

For the css I wanted to make it simple but have a little bit of pizzaz so when you hover over the buttons they change color and we have some clean looking dropdown lists and buttons.

All of the images are taken out of a .json file and I used java script to generate the cards inside of the grid container.

Using tutorials to help figure out how to generate the cards helped a lot and the video I used is down below.

Chat gpt was also a great way to help figure out bugs in my code and get me on the right track.
